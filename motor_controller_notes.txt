PD -> +ve terminal AIR
Driver2 -> -ve terminal AIR
Driver4 -> Solid state relay (By elimination, not by testing!)

Drive1	equals	PWM1, Pin 6. (not plugged in). Get's mapped to driver 5 (PD, pin 2)
Drive2	equals	PWM2, Pin 5. 
	-ve terminal AIR
Drive3	equals	PWM3, Pin 4.(not plugged in) (Mapped to driver 4)
	Getting signal when HV enabled!!
Drive4  equals  PWM4, Pin 3 (power electronics box, driver_precharge). 
	FAULT: Open or short!
	Leads to pin 13 on power electronics board.
Proportional driver (PD) equals PWM5,  Pin 2
	According to Wiring Harness pdf, connected to relay which controls +ve of battery pack
	FAULT: PD open!!

Pin 1: HV Request! to KSI

If it is precharge line and after try precharge give it fault (open/short) must be precharge 
resistor burnt out so it becoems open circut. If precharge fails, will always be open. 

Flipped so many times, might have burned out!

pwm4 and 5 because others couldn't close our relays. 

-ve -> resis -> +ve

pwm 1 and 4: Controlled by Curtis precharge procedure, copied into others.

CAN message when request high?
Set interlock = black magic for precharge

Test if precharge resistor is the issue:
	* Getting the resistor out of the pack is a pain in the ass, so...
	* See if we can close the precharge relay ourselves (tells us if the circuit can be closed)
		* Couldn't be closed if the resisotr is burned out

Changes on 3/14/18:
	* Ignore driver4 and PD fault (was the case in older versions, but not sirius's)
Test on 3/14/18:
	* Set state and setinterlock in firmware to 1 (not waiting for CAN message)
	* Now, enable HV, TSAL turns on, and then turns off a little bit later.
		* Capacitor voltage goes up to 60, then discharges until ~40 when it turns off HV
		* Precharge failed is the reported fault. 
		* AIR- stays at 100% (this is a good thing, I think)
		* Need to check if Driver4 stays closed and if PD gets closed properly (likely the issue)

Notes with Henry - 4/24/18
battery voltage compensation - prechage or main compenstated to be constant. Couldn't turn off on the precharge relay. 
Because precharge photomos is slow, any PWM will fuck it up. 
1->5 because driver 1 current limit is too low (2 amps) (so main contactor couldn't close)
2 for b- because 3 amp rated driver. 

Not typical to have contactor on B- (lower voltage). That's why we have to turn it on ourselves.
TACT troubleshooting

Notes about fault checkign on drivers:
Fault checking NEEDS to be on for the drivers in use. If not, it can result in very serious damage to 
the battery pack. On 5/31/18, FE5's first real test day, the vehicle precharged properly, but then
the AIRs were welded shut, and the main pack fuse was blown as a result of these checks not being 
enabled. This same thing also happened to FE3. 

For FE5, here is a list of driver checks which are enabled and why:
Driver 1 Checks Enable: OFF (not actually connected to anything, only being mirrored)
Driver 2 Checks Enable: ON (-ve AIR)
Driver 3 Checks Enable: OFF (not actually connected to anything, only being mirrored) 
Driver 4 Checks Enable: ON (Driver 3, which is precharge relay, gets mapped to this)
PD Checks Enable: ON (Driver 1, the +ve AIR, is mapped to this)

Regen:
Regen limiting map menu (limit regen current based on speed)
Nominal speed and delta speed
Current limits (regen current limit)


239RPM is 5kmph, can't regen below that speed.
