Parameters:

Main Interlock type 
0 the main contactor and the interlock each work as determined by their respective parameters
1 the main contactor will pull in with KSI. bUT the interlock enables/disables drive and engages interlock braking(like a type 0 or 1 interlock). 

Interlock Type
0 interlock turns on with switch 3
1 interlock controlled by VCL functions
2 interlock turns on with KSI

CANopen Interlock
When programmed On, CAN NMT State must = 5 in order for the interlock to be set// see Monitor » CAN Status menu, page 83.

CANopen - PDO Map Selectors for VCL canopen_write_map() function
CANopen - PDO Map Selectors for VCL canopen_write_map() function •These constants are used to select which PDO to use with the VCL canopen_write_map() function. 
        Constant     1 (0x0001) CAN_OPEN_PDO_MISO_1    
        Constant     2 (0x0002) CAN_OPEN_PDO_MOSI_1    
        Constant     3 (0x0003) CAN_OPEN_PDO_MISO_2    
        Constant     4 (0x0004) CAN_OPEN_PDO_MOSI_2    

how to use:
??  VCL can access to Modulation_Depth ?? % of available voltage being used

1239E_os30_2015 document:

	"When the precharge function is enabled, power will be supplied to the capacitor
bank until the voltage is within 87.5% of the Nominal Voltage setting, or one second
has expired, or the precharge resistor energy range has been exceeded."

enable_precharge()

Precharge_State

0 – Precharge has not yet been done.
1 – Precharge is in progress.
2 – Precharge has passed.
3 – Precharge has been aborted by the Disable_Precharge() function.
4 – Precharge has exceeded the precharge resistor energy limit.
5 – Precharge has exceeded the one-second time limit.

Throttle Type = 5 is that the signal chain
for the throttle now gets its input from a different source. The input to the
throttle chain is now a VCL variable called VCL_Throttle instead of the throttle
pot. Similarly, Brake Type = 5 means the brake signal chain will get its input
from a VCL variable called VCL_Brake rather than from the brake pot. The
VCL_Throttle and VCL_Brake variables will need to be controlled in the VCL
program.

VCL_Throttle  Throttle_Multiplier, and Throttle_Offset -> Mapped_Throttle

10% netrual break. 
2 Torque mode

SPM motor tuning
	
	test mode 1 
	if it's not spining in the right direction, test mode -1. 

Things to do:

look at Henry's code: PDO mapping, VCL throttle.

Test Curtis built in precharge functionality with Battery compensation off next time.

Main contactor is closed sucessfully. PWM 1 & 4. Now the wiring is PWM 4 drive the main contactor. PWM 4 copies PWM 1.

Use Capacitor Voltage to check whether the precharge has been done or not. 

Or main state. 

Things need to go into PDO map.
1. Capacitor Voltage / (main state)
2. VCL_Brake
3. VCL_Throttle
4. Vehicle Speed
5. Main State


So set up your own PDO map. 

Questions for Tyler, 
1. where is the status light. 
2. P[3]2 buzzer. 
3. tachmeter
 

In HV enabled stage, all three relays are closed. 
Only in Drive state you can send VCL throttle (Drive input) command to Curtis through CAN.

The C_EVENT flag is used to tell the system that the data in the mailbox is to
be sent on demand, using the send_mailbox() command.

use clock, send the capacitor voltage and main state every 20ns. ~~

(you don’t demand
a response and you don’t automatically reply), then set the timeout parameter
and reply parameter both to 0.

Main_State
Capacitor_Voltage
Nominal_Voltage
ABS_Mapped_Throttle
ABS_Motor_RPM
MotorSpeedA
MotorSpeedB
Motor_Temperature

Set_interlock
VCL_Throttle
VCL_Brake

Still need to be verified. Speed reading. Capacitor_Voltage / Nominal_Voltage readings. 

6/12/2016
change: read brake msg from pedal node instead of 766 line 347
line 375 add delay for 50

6/15/2016

replace the curtis controller.
